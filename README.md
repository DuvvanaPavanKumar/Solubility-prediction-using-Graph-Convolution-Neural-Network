# Solubility-prediction-using-Graph-Convolution-Neural-Network
The task is to develop a predictive model for solubility of organic compounds in water. This will be achieved by  employing a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN),This project aims for solubility prediction and facilitate  the discovery and development of new chemical compounds with desired solubility characteristics
